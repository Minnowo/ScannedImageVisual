# ScannedImageVisual

this program converts all colors of an image to the colors used in Minecraft map art on a server called vulengate
which has a plugin that lets you paint on a canvas 
using this you can see what an image would look like if you painted it exactly in Minecraft

cli args:
file.exe "name of image to convert" (convert image)
file.exe "name of image to convert" 224x224 (shrink the image to 224x224 and then convert it)
file.exe "name of image to convert" 224 224 (shrink the image to 224x224 and then convert it)

or just run the exe and it will ask for an image to convert (this won't give option to change the image size)
